//V0.1 first test in the car OK => range is 253Km
//V0.2 cleanup from Dala's software (Leaf battery pack upgrade) and SoCx clamping [0..100%] ; 
//quickly valdated on my car, report correctly Soc vs Voltage, range decrease while driving, 
//V0.3 now MIevM is connected on P12V (permanent 12V) , so sleep mode is activated after a delay (20s for instance)
//V0.4 added a NMC under temperature recharge inhibition. tested on bench only!
//				when temp goes below 5Â°C Vmax is puched to 4.2V, main effect is to forbid regular charging and regeneration
//			, changed "char" to "uint8_t" for clarity.
